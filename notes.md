# HTML IDs
- IDs are used to identify one specific element
- JavaScript and CSS can target elements by their ID
- Only one element should have each ID

# <select> and <option>
- <select> creates a dropdown menu
- <option> are the choices inside
- I can get the selected value using .value in JavaScript
# CSS page
- The body tag is for the entire page
- Use #timer for specific elements with an ID
- Use tag names like button or select to style all buttons/selects
- CSS is written outside of each other unless you're nesting with SASS (advanced)
# CSS Fixes I Learned
- CSS selectors must be spelled exactly right (typos break styles)
- Every property in a rule needs a semicolon
- Hover effects are written using selector:hover
